Content mod for our Lethal Company Games

This content mod requires the following mods to be installed:

1. https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/
2. https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Steven/Custom_Boombox_Music/
3. https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CodeEnder/Custom_Boombox_Fix/

Directions until I decide if this should even upload on Thunderstore:

1. On the releases page, click the latest release.
2. Click "Source Code (zip)"
3. Save file.
4. Extract the files from the downloaded zip.
5. Drag the "BepInEx" directory into your Lethal Company directory (ex: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Lethal Company)
6. Accept all (if any) replacements
